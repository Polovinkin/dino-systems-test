1) Made a query which returned amount of seconds during calls of people who called somebody - https://imgur.com/a/szFN79G
2) The calls are free for outgoing calls to phone numbers from Numbers table, so I filtered those people out, leaving only those who are not in that table - https://imgur.com/a/b2Y7SxG
3) Made a sum of all seconds of all calls I've gotten - https://imgur.com/a/GZILgyA
